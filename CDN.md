CDN - CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK 

📄 In this document, I’ve shared my learning about Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). 🌐 You’ll find answers to the “what,” “why,” and “how” ❓💡⚙️ based on my current understanding and research.

**What is CDN?**
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers 🖥️ that work together to deliver web content 📄 to users based on their geographic location 📍.  

**🌟 Why use a CDN?**
1. 🚀 Faster Content Delivery – CDNs serve content from the nearest server to the user, reducing latency and improving load times.
2. 📉 Reduced Load on Origin Server – By caching content across multiple edge servers, the main server handles less traffic.
3. 🔒 Improved Security – CDNs help mitigate DDoS attacks, provide TLS/SSL encryption, and hide the origin server.
4. 📈 Better Scalability – Easily handle spikes in traffic without impacting performance or availability.
